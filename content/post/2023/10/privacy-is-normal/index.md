## Privacy is normal

Privacy is for good guys. It's for mums and bike messengers and foodies.

Privacy is for business meetings and voting booths.

> It's why we have shower curtains.

It's why we have that little padlock icon in our browser bar.

Privacy protects you from discrimination and from identity theft, and it keeps your food-delivery history under wraps.

It can also shield you from those creepy somebody-has-definitely-been-listening-to-my-thoughts ads on social media apps.

> Privacy gives you the power to choose what and with whom you'll share.

It provides safety, control and the right to grant access.

> Privacy gives you the ability to express yourself

To be creative, to spend your time and your money in whatever manner you like, without the scrutiny of others. It protects our intimate moments, our most embarrassing ambitions, our radical ideas and the ability to be our true selves.

> Privacy is freedom, consent, dignity and security
